# web-mining-for-social-good

Worked on an intelligent web crawling system that scraps information from google news and other popular news websites which have an impact on society such as pandemics, natural calamity, disasters, etc. from web to provide recommendations and preventive measures to the user. Used OpenAI API to summarize the contents.
