      "One such method is to use large language models, or LLMs. LLMs are a type of generative AI that are becoming increasingly popular. These models are able to generate text, songs, poems, essays, and even pass exams. However, there is deep concern within the tech industry that these models are being developed too quickly and that they may someday run out of control and damage or destroy human society.\n",

The release of this chatbot has caused a lot of concern within the tech industry, with many people calling for a moratorium on the development of LLMs.\n",

      "Despite these concerns, the development of LLMs is continuing. Hughes has co-founded a new company, Auto-GPT, which is developing a new LLM that is even more powerful than ChatGPT. This new LLM, called Auto-GPT, is able to generate responses to questions without needing to be prompted. This is a significant improvement over ChatGPT, which required the user to prompt it again to keep going.\n",

So if you are trying to generate a list of all the restaurants in a city, for example, you can have Auto-GPT automatically generate the next restaurant name based on the last one it gave you.\n",
